Dear Sir,

I sent another mail earlier, hope you didn't miss that.
If you think I'm not eligible to work under you, or I have any lackings in qualification, please disregard this mail.

I figured out it might be Master of Philosophy (Engineering and IT) which I should apply for. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
The application page asks for a research title, plan and proposal and also the supervisor's name and a proof of contact. So I beleive, it would be really helpful if you provide me some research papers of you, which I'll study to formulate an idea for the research. Also if you have any future research ideas, you can share with me (if you wish), so that I can propose a novel and imapactful idea as I haven't have much experience with bioinformatics. But please have belief in me that I'm a really quick learner.

I'm again really sorry, if I'm asking too much.

Sincerely,
Towhid
